The purpose of this little project is to scrape the URLs and metadata of the 
WBI podcast. Then I aim to generate a RSS feed of that. Maybe I'll download 
them too, and maybe re-upload on archive.org .

# Notes:

Went on https://americanassembly.org/wbi-podcast

I see episodes from 2020-03-19 to 2022-03-07 .
